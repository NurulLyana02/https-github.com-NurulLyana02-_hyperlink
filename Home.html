<center><h1>WELCOME TO MY PAGE!</h1>
<p> Assalamualaikum, hi everyone! Welcome to my new website! this is where
I'm going to share all of my new experiences, knowledge and precious moments 
during my time as a student at UiTM Kedah. </p> 

<p>Honestly, I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and backgrounds. 
I can almost always find common ground with strangers and I like to make people feel comfortable with my presence.
 I find these skills very helpful when starting any activity with a new friend. </p>

<p> I hope that you will enjoy with my Journey! </p>
